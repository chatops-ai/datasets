## Contributing 

Pull requests are more than welcome, they're encouraged. Each pull request should include a folder with a name that reflects the intent that will be used to train. The folder should include only .txt files, with one "User says" statement per line. Each file should have a short title describing what defines it from the rest using "-" as a separator. 

Have fun! 🐧
